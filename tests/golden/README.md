# OpenWebNet Golden Corpus Conformance Suite

A declarative conformance suite of OpenWebNet frames providing cross-framework verification across Home Assistant (`MyHOME` / `OWNd`), openHAB (`openwebnet4j` & `org.openhab.binding.openwebnet`), and official Legrand OpenWebNet specifications via `openwebnet-mcp`.

## The Three Authorities Triad

| Layer | Source | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Judge** | Official Legrand PDFs via `openwebnet-mcp` | Validates whether a frame is syntactically legal (its semantics are not authoritative; see Provenance below) |
| **Oracle** | `openwebnet4j` & openHAB binding (by Massimo Valla) | Provides mature reference factory outputs and empirical test vectors |
| **SUT** | `OWNd` / `custom_components/myhome` | System Under Test: verified against judge and oracle |

## Provenance: which fixtures may change

Only `community-plant-capture` fixtures were recorded from a real bus. They are facts: never edit their frame, `what`, `where` or dimension values. If OWNd disagrees with a capture, OWNd is wrong.

Every other source (`legrand-spec`, `encyclopedia`, `openwebnet4j`, `public-readme`, `mcp-draft`) is a reading of a document or of another implementation, and can be wrong. Such a fixture may be corrected, but only in a commit that names the source it now follows (page and commit) and explains what was wrong.

- `mcp_valid: true` means openwebnet-mcp accepted the **grammar**. It is not evidence of meaning: the judge's WHO 15 catalog described `*15*1*11#2##` as "short press on button 2", which is how three wrong CEN fixtures entered this corpus (corrected in OpenWebNet-HA/OWNd#49). Its WHO 25 catalog did the same for `*25*21#1*12##`, `*25*22#1*12##` and `*25*24#1*12##`: `12` is not a CEN+ Object (`WHERE` is `2` + Object 0..2047). Those were replaced by a capture in the same PR.
- A `builder:` block proves the builder matches the fixture, not that either is right. When both are written in the same change from the same reading, the test only compares the code with itself. Prefer builder parity against a capture or an independent source such as `openwebnet4j`.
- When a capture arrives for a frame that so far exists only as a spec-derived fixture, add the capture and keep the spec entry only if it agrees.

## Supported Subsystems Catalog (58 Fixtures)

- **Signaling (`who00_signaling.yaml`)**: Gateway ACK (`*#*1##`) and NACK (`*#*0##`).
- **WHO=0 Scenarios (`who00_scenario.yaml`)**: Basic scenario execution and stop.
- **WHO=1 Lighting (`who01_lighting.yaml`)**: Point-to-point ON/OFF, status requests, local bus routing (`0311#4#01`), group broadcast, speed transitions (`*1*1#5*12##`), and dimension writes.
- **WHO=2 Automation (`who02_automation.yaml`)**: Shutter UP/DOWN/STOP, private bus routing (`21#4#1`), absolute position percentages, and slat tilt angles. Records tagged `scope` pin OWNd's general / area / group classification; an MH201 capture (MyHOME#433) adds an area-1 stop echo (`*2*0*1##`) and the per-actuator end-of-run stop that closes a general UP: a scope command never gets a stop of its own (WHO_2.pdf §3.0.1).
- **WHO=4 Thermoregulation (`who04_thermo.yaml`)**: Measured temperature queries (`21.5°C`), setpoint writes, Antifreeze/Protection modes, and negative temperature probe status (`-4.8°C`).
- **WHO=5 Burglar Alarm (`who05_alarm.yaml`)**: Status requests and silent alarm events across zones and central units.
- **WHO=9 Auxiliary (`who09_auxiliary.yaml`)**: Activation and deactivation of AUX relay channels.
- **WHO=13 Gateway Management (`who13_gateway.yaml`)**: Firmware versions and gateway internal datetime responses.
- **WHO=15 CEN Pushbuttons (`who15_cen.yaml`)**: Pressure, short release, long release and extended pressure (`*15*BUTTON[#1|#2|#3]*WHERE##`).
- **WHO=18 Energy Management (`who18_energy.yaml`)**: Instantaneous active power and cumulative energy totalizers.
- **WHO=25 CEN+ / Dry Contacts (`who25_cen_plus.yaml`)**: CEN+ short press, hold start, hold repeat and release (`*25*21..24#PUSHBUTTON*2OBJECT##`, captured on an MH201) and a dry-contact event (`*25*31#1*WHERE##`).

## Running Conformance Verification

To validate all YAML fixtures against `schema.json` and synchronize `corpus.json`:
```powershell
& "C:\Users\laurensvdb\Documents\GitHub\MyHOME\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" tools/golden/validate_corpus.py
```

To run the automated pytest conformance suite (zero external dependencies required):
```powershell
& "C:\Users\laurensvdb\Documents\GitHub\MyHOME\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" -m pytest tests/test_golden_conformance.py -v
```
